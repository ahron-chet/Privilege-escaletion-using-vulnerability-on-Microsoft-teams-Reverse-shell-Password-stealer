# Privilege-escaletion-using-vulnerability-on-Microsoft-teams-Reverse-shell-Password-stealer

Privilege escalation using vulnerability on Microsoft teams  by doing process injection and dll proxing.
Reverse shell, Password stealer, jupyter notebook token sniffer, ransomware based on my encryption algorithm and persistence, by exploiting Teams vulnerability on Teams, also the program have the capability to run some hacking tools wich i wich i developed on python and used on the attacker side using jupyter note book Token sniffing that will be shared with ngrok.

Also the program have the capability to do uac bypass and steal all credential and passwords including all browser passwords, wifi passwords, and Windows passwords, by dumping lsass amd sam.

The program doesn't get blocked or detect by any anti virus or edr, the shell is completely hidden using stenography, 
i used invoke-psimage to hide the bytes of the shell script behind the pixels of an image, that generate a command line to extract the relevant bytes from the image pixels, I abded this command into the trojan dll and when Microsoft Teams will try to load the dll, the command line will extract the script from the image and the script will be execute.

The trojan dll will make forwards of all the original function to the original dll so the program does not crush when Microsoft teams will try to use one of the original functions of the original dll.

In order to run program successfully and generate full payload
download this repository, run the file named GeneratePayload.py and follow the instruction.
