# Hacking Microsoft Teams to Elevate Privileges, Perform Reverse Shell Attack, Steal Passwords, and Achieve Persistence Through a Vulnerability

Exploiting a vulnerability that i have discovered in Microsoft Teams that allows for privilege escalation through process injection and DLL proxying. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information and execute a variety of malicious actions on the compromised system.

# These actions include:

 - A reverse shell
 - A password stealer
 - A Jupyter notebook token sniffer
 - Ransomware based on my custom encryption algorithm 
 - Persistence
 - Stenography

In addition, the program has the capability to run hacking tools developed in Python using a Jupyter notebook, including a token sniffer shared through ngrok. This --allows the attacker to remotely access the compromised system and perform additional malicious actions.

The program is also able to bypass UAC and extract all stored credentials and passwords, including browser passwords, WiFi passwords, and Windows passwords, by dumping LSASS and SAM. This allows the attacker to gain access to a wide range of sensitive information stored on the system.

To ensure that the program goes undetected, it employs advanced techniques to hide the attack's tracks. The shell is completely hidden using stenography, which involves hiding the bytes of the shell script behind the pixels of an image. This is achieved through the use of invoke-psimage, which generates a command line to extract the relevant bytes when the Trojan DLL is loaded by Microsoft Teams. The Trojan DLL also includes forwarders for all original functions of the original DLL, ensuring that the program does not crash when Microsoft Teams attempts to use these functions.

To run the program and generate the full payload, download the repository, run the file named 'GeneratePayload.py', and follow the instructions.
